friarJohn, by the permieeion of God priest of Canterbury Primetc
of all llngland greeting in great reverencc. Sire, it appears to
me that the people of Walee' ia too ravage, and grievonsly
malicione, as to many of them, and little knowing good, and a
aetion lost without profit to tho world. And if yon plcasc,
yon may lightly put a remcdy in this manner, unless a
better in found. First, Sire, their servagenem, with other evils,
arinen chiefly frorn thie, thot they do not dwell together, bnt
each fer from the other. And therefore, Sine, if you wieh thern
to bc reformed according to (lod aad the world, and their
cavagcncas taken away, command them to dwell together in
tenne. 'l'hin did an emperor enciently to tho Burgundiana, who
were robbers and morderem, and ‹lwelt all separated end far
from each otlrer; for he caused them to nesemhle aad dwell in
boronghn, and therefore they are called Burgnndiann. Bcaidee
thie. tlire, the evil nature of the Weleh arises much from their
idleneae, for they are idle, nrrd therefore they think all avil. And
therefore, Sire, command that each according to his estate
ahonld do every day something, ao that it rnay be known how
each erne gete hia living. And I hare commanded, on tha other
hand, the sacramente of Holy Ohnrch to be refused fo thc idle,
because nc one ie in a stete of calvetion who doee no profit to the
world. And therefore, Sire, order ¹the manner of living called
Wyenlnrninglmn¹ fobe entirely aboliahed. Benidee thie, Sire, the
